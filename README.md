# Feature-vectors-of-RPLAN-dataset
This program is explored to vectorize the RPLAN dataset, transforming each sample to a feature vector, in which the attributes encompass details of every label.

The necessary package and program includes PIL, potrace, and svgpathtools.

The RPLAN dataset is needed, please see https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfwteilXzURRKDI5QopWCyOGkeb_CFFbRwtQ0SOPhEg0KGSfw/viewform?usp=sf_link

We're going to upload the program soon.
