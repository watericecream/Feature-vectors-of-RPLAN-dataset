# Feature-vectors-of-RPLAN-dataset
This program is explored to vectorize the RPLAN dataset, transforming each sample to a feature vector, in which the attributes encompass details of every label.

The necessary package and program includes PIL, potrace, imageio, and svgpathtools.

The RPLAN dataset is needed, please see https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfwteilXzURRKDI5QopWCyOGkeb_CFFbRwtQ0SOPhEg0KGSfw/viewform?usp=sf_link

Upon completion of the program, you will receive a folder containing all the samples in .npy files, named with serial numbers, which represent the feature vectors.

You can also change the setup to save all samples' vectors in one .npy file, but we don't recommend this because of the possible interruption.
